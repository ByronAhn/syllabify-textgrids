#
# This script depends on three things
#   (1) syllabify-core.py in the same directory
#   (2) textgrids in a folder called "input" in the same directory
#   (3) those textgrids MUST have a "Words" tier and a "Phones" tier, with the "Phones" tier containing ARPABET transcriptions
#         (ARPABET Phones can be added through a forced aligner like the Montreal Forced Aligner: https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/)
#
# This script then creates two things
#   (1) *modified* textgrids in a subdirectory called "syllabified"
#   (2) an R dataframe called `syllableDF` that contains all the syllable information
#

## check if relevant libraries are installed; if not, install them

## load up those libraries
library(tidyverse)
# `PraatR` lets you call (pre-existing) Praat binaries to do Praat functions, from R (http://www.aaronalbin.com/praatr/index.html)
library(PraatR)
# `rPraat` lets you manipulate Praat files (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rPraat/index.html)
library(rPraat)
# `reticulate` lets you pass variables between python and R (https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)
library(reticulate)
# `here` lets you get the directory path of the present script
library(here)

## load up the Python script written by Kyle Gorman (https://github.com/kylebgorman/syllabify/)

#	this script does the heavy-lifting for doing English syllabification
